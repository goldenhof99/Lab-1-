## My favourite thing I've written.
Hello my name is Gabriel Oldenhof. I am second year Business Technology Management student. One piece I am very proud that I have written in the past was my pitch script for a mock business pitch competition. 

The script was the reason we won the challenge. It followed the business pitch script guidelines very well allowing for a very easy delivery for the presentation itself. This allowed us to win the presentation getting our group the highest amount of investment in the challenge.
